# Machine-Learning-Project
• Developed a predictive model using Machine Learning algorithms to predict a target variable.
• Cleaned and pre-processed raw customer data, examined features to identify correlations, and engineered new features to improve accuracy of the model
• Utilized Python, Scikit-learn to train and evaluate the model
• Achieved an R-squared of 0.91, demonstrating the efficiency of the model.
